“Computer programming is an art because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world, because it requires skills and ingenuity, and especially because it produces objects of beauty.” Donald Knuth, 1974

# What is programming like?
## I.  Programming is like writing a proof in geometry...

|   Geometry                     |    Programming    |
|:-------------------------------|:------------------|
|There is a starting point,      | Inputs            |
|There is a goal or ending-point | Output            |
|The body of the proof is logical progression of steps from the starting point to the ending-point| Processing or algorithm |

## II. Programming is like "solving a problem another way...." (CT)
Do you remember in math class, you would find the solution to a problem, and then the teacher would say, "OK, now let's
find a *DIFFERENT* way to solve the problem?"
* Given a problem, you may immediately think of a way to solve it; BUT
* It may *NOT* be possible to solve that problem "the human" way using a computer language, so...
* You have to be _*CREATIVE*_ and use "__*computational thinking*__" (__CT__) to find an "algorighmic way" to solve the problem.
Developing "computational thinking" takes time.  It's like learning another way of thinking....

## III. Finding your way around in a new place...
Imagine that you have always wanted to visit Paris, and that you have finally arrived in your hotel.  Now, you want to go
see the Eiffel Tower!  How will you get there?  The "input" is your starting place at your hotel, and the "output" is your
desired destination: The Eiffel Tower!  There are a few ways that you might get there: walking, bus, metro (subway), or
by car (Uber, Lyft, taxi, etc).  If you went by walking, bus, or metro, you might get lost (encounter a "bug"), but then
you would explore and find your way there (and, in reality, back to your hotel).  Finding your way exploring a new place
is similar to writing a program.

# If you get stuck ...
People rarely ever read a problem and immediately wrote down a correct program.  Instead, the process
of writing a program to solve a problem can be challenging.  Be sure that you start your assignments early
so that you have time to "wrestle" with these problems and strengthen your problem-solving skills:

# Debugging...
...means finding the causes of errors and fixing them so that the system works as intended.  Back in the days when computers filled
rooms, apparently a realy moth actually caused an electrical short (hardware bug) that caused some kind of malfunction in the
computer.  The people who found the fried moth pulled it out and literally "debugged" the system.  Apparently the moth now belongs
to the Smithsonian Institute.

# NOTE: There are Problems that Can NEVER Be Solved by Computer(!)
* Alan Turing (1912-1954)
* Credited with developing the system at Bletchley Park that cracked the "unbreakable" German Naval Enigma Code during WWII
* Also developed the idea of "Turing "Machines" -- NOTE: Turing "Machines" are __*NOT*__ "real" machines, but hypothetical "general purpose" computers that did not yet exist when Alan Turing first imagined them in the 1930s.
